   - Automated report generation

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Immutable transaction logs

   - System event logs

**Implementation Recommendations:**

```javascript
// Transaction Monitoring Service
class AMLMonitoringService {
  async monitorTransaction(transaction) {
    const alerts = [];
    
    // Check amount thresholds
    if (transaction.amount >= 10000) {
      alerts.push({
        type: 'CTR_REQUIRED',
        severity: 'high',
        transaction: transaction._id
      });
    }
    
    // Check for structuring
    const recentTxs = await this.getRecentTransactions(
      transaction.user,
      24 // hours
    );
    if (this.detectStructuring(recentTxs)) {
      alerts.push({
        type: 'POTENTIAL_STRUCTURING',
        severity: 'critical'
      });
    }
    
    // Sanctions screening
    const sanctionsHit = await this.screenSanctions(transaction.user);
    if (sanctionsHit) {
      alerts.push({
        type: 'SANCTIONS_HIT',
        severity: 'critical',
        list: sanctionsHit.list
      });
      // Block transaction
      return { allowed: false, reason: 'Sanctions screening hit' };
    }
    
    // Log alerts
    for (const alert of alerts) {
      await this.createAlert(alert);
    }
    
    return { allowed: true, alerts };
  }
  
  detectStructuring(transactions) {
    // Detect multiple transactions just below reporting threshold
    const justBelowThreshold = transactions.filter(
      tx => tx.amount >= 9000 && tx.amount < 10000
    );
    return justBelowThreshold.length >= 3;
  }
}
```

**Remediation Priority:** **HIGH**

### 1.4 Licensing & Registration

**Status:** ❌ NOT COMPLIANT

**Required Licenses (United States):**

1. **FinCEN Registration** (Federal)
   - Status: ❌ NOT REGISTERED
   - Requirement: Register as Money Services Business (MSB)
   - Deadline: Before operations begin
   - Cost: Free registration, but compliance costs significant

2. **State Money Transmitter Licenses**
   - Status: ❌ NOT LICENSED
   - Requirement: License in each state of operation
   - States: Up to 49 states require license (Montana exempt)
   - Cost: $50,000 - $500,000+ per state

- UK: FCA authorization
- Canada: FINTRAC registration
- Australia: AUSTRAC registration
- Singapore: MAS license

**Current Business Model Issues:**
- Currently operating as marketplace
- Handling customer funds = money transmission
- Processing cryptocurrency transactions = MSB activity
- **Legal Risk:** HIGH - Operating without licenses

**Remediation Steps:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Consult with cryptocurrency regulatory attorney
   - Determine business model (MSB vs. non-custodial)
   - Assess state-by-state requirements

2. **If Operating as MSB:**
   - Register with FinCEN
   - Apply for state licenses (6-18 months)
   - Implement full AML/KYC program
   - Obtain surety bonds per state
   - Maintain minimum net worth requirements

3. **Alternative: Non-Custodial Model**
   - User controls their own wallets
   - Platform facilitates transactions only
   - May reduce licensing requirements
   - Still requires legal review

   - Option A: Full MSB (custodial) - Full compliance required
   - Option B: Non-custodial platform - Reduced requirements
   - Option C: Hybrid model - Partial requirements

3. **Compliance Team** - HIGH
   - Hire or designate compliance officer
   - Establish compliance committee
   - Allocate compliance budget

### Short-Term (3-6 Months)

## 15. Alternative: Non-Custodial Model

**Consideration:** To reduce compliance burden, consider non-custodial model

**Non-Custodial Characteristics:**
- Users control their own wallets
- Platform facilitates peer-to-peer transactions
- Platform never holds customer funds
- Reduced (but not eliminated) compliance requirements

**Still Required in Non-Custodial Model:**
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Basic AML procedures
- Sanctions screening
- GDPR compliance
- Some state registrations may still be required

**Advantages:**
- Lower compliance costs
- Faster time to market
- Reduced regulatory risk

**Disadvantages:**
- Different user experience
- Technical complexity
- Still requires legal review

## 16. Conclusion

The Cryptons.com cryptocurrency marketplace **is not currently compliant** with the regulatory requirements necessary to operate as a production cryptocurrency exchange or marketplace in major jurisdictions.

### Critical Findings:

1. **No KYC/AML Program** - Cannot legally operate as MSB
2. **No Licensing** - Operating without required licenses
3. **No Legal Documentation** - Significant legal risk
4. **Partial GDPR Compliance** - Risk for EU users
5. **No Transaction Monitoring** - Cannot detect illegal activity

### Risk Assessment:

**Current Legal Risk:** **CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION**

**Minimum Timeline to Compliance:**
- Basic compliance: 3-4 months
- Full licensing: 12-18 months
- Comprehensive compliance: 18-24 months

**Minimum Investment Required:**
- Initial: $450,000 - $1,100,000
- Annual ongoing: $265,000 - $700,000

### Recommendation:

**DO NOT deploy this platform to production** until:
1. Legal consultation completed
2. Business model determined
3. Critical compliance gaps addressed
4. Appropriate licenses obtained
5. Compliance program fully implemented

The platform can continue to operate as a **development/demo environment** but must not:
- Accept real customer funds
- Process real cryptocurrency transactions
- Operate in any U.S. state or foreign jurisdiction
- Market services to the public

**Alternative:** Consider non-custodial model to reduce compliance burden, but still requires legal review and basic compliance measures.
