## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. ✅ Schedule legal consultation for compliance strategy
2. ✅ Begin JWT token revocation implementation
3. ✅ Configure production secrets vault
4. ✅ Enable database encryption at rest
5. ✅ Set up basic monitoring and alerting

### Short-term (Months 1-3)

1. ✅ Complete all CRITICAL security items
2. ✅ Implement GDPR data subject rights
3. ✅ Set up comprehensive monitoring
4. ✅ Configure automated backups
5. ✅ Complete penetration testing
6. ✅ Finish legal documentation

### Medium-term (Months 3-6)

1. ✅ Complete state licensing applications
2. ✅ Implement full KYC/AML program
3. ✅ Complete all HIGH priority items
4. ✅ Conduct DR drill
5. ✅ Launch beta program

### Long-term (Months 6-12)

1. ✅ Complete all state licenses
2. ✅ Full production launch
3. ✅ Continuous improvement program
4. ✅ Regular security audits
5. ✅ Scale to additional jurisdictions

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** Platform is at 45% production readiness

**Critical Blockers:** 
- No KYC/AML compliance (legal blocker)
- Missing security hardening (technical blocker)
- No backup/DR strategy (operational blocker)

**Recommendation:** 
DO NOT deploy to production until all BLOCKING gates are cleared. Platform is suitable for continued development and staging but requires 3-4 months minimum (fast track) or 12-18 months (full compliance) before production deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this checklist
2. Assign owners to each category
3. Create detailed implementation plan
4. Begin with CRITICAL priority items
5. Schedule weekly progress reviews

**Document End**

*This production readiness checklist should be reviewed and updated monthly as progress is made toward production deployment.*
