## Security Advisories

### CVE-2024-XXXX (Pending)
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: JWT Token Revocation  
**Status**: Documented, fix pending

JWT tokens cannot be revoked before expiration. Compromised tokens remain valid until expiry.

**Mitigation**: Keep token expiry short (7 days default). See [audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for implementation guide.

### CVE-2024-XXXX (Pending)
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Webhook Signature Verification  
**Status**: Documented, fix pending

Payment webhooks lack signature verification, allowing potential webhook spoofing attacks.

**Mitigation**: Implement webhook signature verification before production. See [audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for details.
