## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

If you're contributing to Cryptons.com, please:

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Update dependencies**: Keep all packages up to date
3. **Follow secure coding practices**: Review [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)
4. **Test security features**: Write tests for security-critical code
5. **Review the audit reports**: Understand the security landscape in [audit/](audit/)

### For Users/Deployers

Before deploying Cryptons.com:

1. **Read the security audit**: Review [audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
2. **Complete the production checklist**: See [audit/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md](audit/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md)
3. **Implement critical fixes**: Address all critical and high-severity findings
4. **Enable security features**: Configure all security middleware properly
5. **Use HTTPS**: Always use TLS/SSL in production
6. **Rotate secrets**: Change all default secrets and keys
7. **Enable monitoring**: Set up logging and alerting
8. **Backup regularly**: Implement automated backup strategies
9. **Stay updated**: Subscribe to security advisories

## Known Security Considerations

⚠️ **Production Use Warning**: This platform requires additional security hardening before production deployment. See our comprehensive security audit reports:

### Critical Items (Must Fix Before Production)

1. **JWT Token Revocation** - Not implemented ([audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](audit/SECURITY_AUDIT.md))
2. **Webhook Signature Verification** - Missing for payment webhooks
3. **Database Encryption at Rest** - Not configured
4. **Production CORS Configuration** - Currently allows all origins
5. **Secrets Management** - Environment variables need vault solution

### Compliance Requirements

Before production deployment with real transactions:

1. **KYC/AML Program** - Must be implemented for cryptocurrency operations
2. **FinCEN Registration** - Required in the United States
3. **State Licenses** - Money transmitter licenses may be required
4. **Terms of Service** - Legal agreements must be in place
5. **Privacy Policy** - GDPR and privacy compliance required

See [audit/COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md](audit/COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md) for complete details.
