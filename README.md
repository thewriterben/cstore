- Vite for fast build tooling

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Backend API server running (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- Admin user account with proper credentials

#### Installation & Development

1. Navigate to the admin dashboard directory:
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment (if needed):
```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
# Edit .env.development with your API URL if different from default
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

5. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized production build will be in the `dist/` directory.

#### Production Deployment

**Integrated Deployment:**
The dashboard can be served directly by the backend server. After building, the backend automatically serves the dashboard at:
```
http://your-domain.com/admin
```

**Standalone Deployment:**
The dashboard can also be deployed independently to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.). Configure the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable to point to your backend API.

### Authentication & Security

- **Admin-Only Access**: Only users with the `admin` role can access the dashboard
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout on token expiration
- **HTTPS Required**: Production deployments must use HTTPS for security

**Default Admin Setup:**
Ensure you have created an admin user via the backend API before accessing the dashboard. Use the `/api/users/register` endpoint with `role: "admin"` (requires proper configuration).

### Development Workflow

**Available Scripts:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

**Development Best Practices:**
- TypeScript types are defined in `src/types/`
- Redux slices are in `src/store/`
- API services are in `src/services/`
- Reusable components are in `src/components/`

For comprehensive documentation, architecture details, and troubleshooting, see [admin-dashboard/README.md](admin-dashboard/README.md)

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The project implements a **production-grade CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions, providing automated testing, security scanning, and multi-environment deployment with zero-downtime strategies.

### Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD system consists of three comprehensive workflows that ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments:

#### 1. Continuous Integration Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Automated Quality Assurance:**
- **Code Quality Checks**

- **Testing Suite**
  - Jest unit and integration tests
  - Code coverage reporting with threshold enforcement
  - Test result artifacts and reports
  - Parallel test execution for speed
  
- **Security Scanning**

  - Trivy container scanning for Docker images
  - OWASP dependency checks
  
- **Build Verification**
  - Docker multi-stage builds with layer caching
  - Image size optimization checks
  - Build artifact validation
  - Registry push for tagged releases

**Triggers:** Push to any branch, Pull Requests, scheduled runs
