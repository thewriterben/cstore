# Multi-Signature Wallet Support

## Overview

The CStore platform now supports multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets to enhance security for cryptocurrency transactions. Multi-sig wallets require multiple parties to approve transactions before they are executed, providing an additional layer of security and governance.

## Features

- **Configurable Signature Requirements**: Set up wallets with N-of-M signature requirements (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5)
- **Multiple Signers**: Add multiple authorized signers to a wallet
- **Transaction Approval Workflow**: Transactions require approval from the specified number of signers before execution
- **Role-Based Permissions**: 
  - Wallet owners can manage wallet settings and signers
  - Signers can approve or reject transactions
- **Support for Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: BTC, ETH, and USDT
- **Transaction Status Tracking**: Monitor transaction status through the approval process
- **Integration with Orders**: Associate transactions with orders for seamless payment processing
- **Expiration Support**: Transactions can expire if not approved within the specified timeframe

## Architecture

Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "transactionHash": "0x1234567890abcdef..."
}
```

**Notes:**
- Transaction must be in "approved" status
- Requires blockchain transaction hash from the executed transaction
- If blockchain verification is enabled, the transaction will be verified
- If associated with an order, the order status will be updated to "paid"
- A payment record will be created in the system

#### Cancel Transaction
```http
DELETE /api/wallets/multi-sig/transactions/:id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Notes:**
- Only the transaction initiator or wallet owner can cancel
- Can only cancel transactions with "pending" status

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet

1. **Create Users**: Ensure all signers have accounts in the system
2. **Create Wallet**: Owner creates a multi-sig wallet with required signers
3. **Verify Setup**: All signers should verify they can see the wallet in their account

### Example 2: Processing a Payment with Multi-Sig

1. **Create Order**: Customer creates an order as usual
2. **Initiate Transaction**: Owner or signer creates a transaction approval request linked to the order
3. **Collect Approvals**: Required number of signers approve the transaction
4. **Execute Payment**: Once approved, any authorized party broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain
5. **Confirm Payment**: Execute the transaction with the blockchain transaction hash
6. **Order Processing**: Order status automatically updates to "paid"

### Example 3: Rejecting a Transaction

1. **Review Transaction**: Signers review the pending transaction
2. **Reject**: If a signer finds an issue, they reject with a comment
3. **Status Update**: Transaction immediately moves to "rejected" status
4. **Notification**: System logs the rejection for audit trail

## Admin Endpoints

Administrators have access to specialized endpoints for monitoring and managing multi-sig wallets across the platform.

## Security Features

### Authorization

- **Wallet Access**: Users can only access wallets they own or are signers for
- **Transaction Approval**: Only authorized signers can approve transactions
- **Wallet Management**: Only wallet owners can modify settings and manage signers
- **Transaction Cancellation**: Only initiator or owner can cancel pending transactions

### Validation

- **Minimum Signers**: At least 2 signers required for multi-sig wallet
- **Signature Requirements**: Required signatures must be ≥ 2 and ≤ number of signers
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Signers cannot approve the same transaction twice
- **Status Checks**: Operations validated against current transaction status
- **Expiration**: Transactions can expire if not approved in time

### Rate Limiting

Enhanced rate limiting specifically for multi-sig approval operations:
- **Approval Requests**: Limited to 50 requests per hour per IP address
- **Protection**: Prevents approval request flooding and potential abuse
- **Bypass**: Rate limiting is skipped for unauthenticated requests

### Security Logging

Comprehensive audit trail for all multi-sig operations:

**Dedicated Security Log File** (`logs/security.log`)
- Separate from main application logs
- 10 file rotation with 5MB each
- Structured JSON format for easy parsing

**Logged Operations:**
1. **Wallet Creation**
   - Wallet ID, owner ID and email
   - Wallet configuration (name, address, cryptocurrency)
   - Number of signers and required signatures
   - List of signer emails

2. **Transaction Creation**
   - Transaction ID, wallet ID, user ID and email
   - Amount, cryptocurrency, and addresses
   - Order ID (if linked)
   - Required approvals count

3. **Transaction Approval**
   - Transaction ID, wallet ID, user ID and email
   - Approval decision (approved/rejected)
   - Comment and signature presence
   - Current vs required approvals
   - New transaction status

4. **Transaction Execution**
   - Transaction ID, wallet ID, executor ID and email
   - Blockchain transaction hash
   - Amount, cryptocurrency, and addresses
   - Order ID (if linked)
   - Verification status

**Log Entry Example:**
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Multi-sig transaction_approval",
  "operation": "transaction_approval",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-01T10:30:00.000Z",
  "transactionId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "walletId": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
  "userId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439012",
  "userEmail": "signer@example.com",
  "approved": true,
  "currentApprovals": 2,
  "requiredApprovals": 2,
  "newStatus": "approved",
  "service": "cstore-security",
  "category": "multi-sig"
}
```

### Blockchain Verification

When `VERIFY_BLOCKCHAIN=true` in environment:
- Transaction hash is verified on the blockchain
- Amount and recipient address are validated
- Confirmations are tracked
- Failed verifications prevent payment confirmation

## Integration with Existing System

The multi-sig wallet system integrates seamlessly with:

- **User System**: Leverages existing user authentication and management
- **Order System**: Transactions can be linked to orders
- **Payment System**: Creates payment records upon transaction execution
- **Blockchain Service**: Uses existing blockchain verification infrastructure

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables required. Uses existing configuration:
- `VERIFY_BLOCKCHAIN`: Enable/disable blockchain verification
- `ETH_RPC_URL`: Ethereum RPC endpoint
- Other blockchain service configurations

## Best Practices

### For Wallet Owners

1. Choose trusted signers carefully
2. Set appropriate signature requirements (e.g., 2-of-3 for small teams, 3-of-5 for larger)
3. Regularly review and update signer list
4. Keep wallet descriptions up to date
5. Monitor pending transactions regularly

### For Signers

1. Review transaction details carefully before approving
2. Verify the destination address matches the intended recipient
3. Check the amount is correct
4. Add meaningful comments when approving/rejecting
5. Respond promptly to approval requests to avoid expiration

### For Developers

1. Always check transaction status before operations
2. Handle expired transactions gracefully
3. Provide clear feedback to users about approval progress
4. Log all approval actions for audit trail
5. Test multi-sig workflows thoroughly
