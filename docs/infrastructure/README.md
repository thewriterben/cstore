  - Architecture diagrams
  - Quick start guide
  - Production checklist
  - Deployment manifests

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing with GitHub Actions
- Continuous integration
- Automated deployment
- See [.github/workflows/](../../.github/workflows/) for workflow definitions

## 📖 Recommended Reading Order

1. **CICD_PIPELINE.md** - CI/CD overview
2. [k8s/README.md](../../k8s/README.md) - Kubernetes deployment
3. [scripts/deployment/README.md](../../scripts/deployment/README.md) - Deployment scripts
4. Environment-specific configuration guides

## 🔒 Production Considerations

### Before Production Deployment
- ✅ Implement all critical security features
- ✅ Configure production CORS
- ✅ Set up secrets management
- ✅ Configure database encryption
- ✅ Set up monitoring and logging
- ✅ Configure backup and disaster recovery
- ✅ Load testing and performance tuning

### Infrastructure Requirements
- MongoDB cluster with replication
- Redis for session management
- Load balancer
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Monitoring system (Prometheus/Grafana recommended)
- Log aggregation (ELK stack recommended)
