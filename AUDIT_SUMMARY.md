   - No KYC/AML = money laundering exposure

2. **Security Risk** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Token revocation gap = session hijacking risk
   - Webhook spoofing = fraudulent payments
   - No encryption at rest = data breach exposure

3. **Operational Risk** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH
   - No backups = data loss risk
   - No monitoring = blind to issues
   - No DR plan = extended downtime

4. **Compliance Risk** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - GDPR violations = €20M or 4% revenue fines
   - No data protection = legal liability
   - Privacy violations = user lawsuits
